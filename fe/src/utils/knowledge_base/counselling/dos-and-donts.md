TRAUMA-INFORMED DOs AND DON’Ts v1.1

Core principles (WHO PFA “Look Listen Link” + SAMHSA)
Look – scan danger, basic needs, caller emotion
Listen – full attention, non-judgmental, survivor sets pace
Link – safety plan, medical, police, social services

DO
• Speak steady, low tone; allow silence  
• Validate: "You did the right thing reaching out"  
• Ask early: "Are you in a safe place to talk?"  
• Guide grounding: slow breath, name room objects  
• State next steps and confidentiality limits  
• Escalate immediately if violence or suicide risk is live

DON’T
• No blame questions "What did you do?"  
• Do not pressure for details; caller chooses what to share  
• Do not interrupt or fill pauses; listen more than talk  
• Do not promise outcomes you can’t control  
• Never minimise abuse "just words", "boys will be boys"

Escalation trigger matrix
Violence happening or weapon​ → warm transfer SPF  
Child or elder at risk → warm transfer CPS or APS  
Suicidal intent or plan → warm transfer SOS
