## TRAUMA-INFORMED DOs & DON’Ts (v1.0)

### Core Principles (WHO PFA “Look Listen Link” + SAMHSA)

- Look → scan danger, basic needs, caller’s emotion
- Listen → give full attention, non-judgemental, survivor sets pace
- Link → offer safety plan, medical, police, social services

### DO

- Speak steady, low tone; allow silence for emotion
- Validate: “You did the right thing reaching out”
- Ask early: “Are you in a safe place to talk?”
- Guide grounding: slow breath, describe room objects
- State next steps + confidentiality limits
- Escalate fast if violence or suicide is live

### DON’T

- Blame questions (“What did you do?”)
- Pressure for details; caller chooses what to share
- Interrupt or fill pauses—listen > talk
- Promise outcomes you cannot control
- Minimise abuse (“just words”, “boys will be boys”)

### Escalation-Trigger Matrix

| Trigger                              | Immediate Action         |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Violence happening / weapons present | Warm-transfer SPF        |
| Child or elder harmed / at risk      | Warm-transfer CPS or APS |
| Suicidal intent, plan, means         | Warm-transfer SOS        |
