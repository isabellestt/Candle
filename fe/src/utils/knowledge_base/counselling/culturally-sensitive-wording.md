SINGAPORE CULTURAL-SENSITIVITY WORDING v1.1

Avoid → Problem → Say instead

1. "When he beats you next…" → Fatalistic; blames victim → "If things become dangerous…"
2. "In your culture men are like that." → Ethnic/religious stereotype → "Abuse is never acceptable, whatever the culture."
3. "What will people think?" → Triggers shame / loss of face → "Your safety matters more than others' opinions."
4. "It's just words." → Minimises emotional harm → "Emotional abuse causes real harm."
5. "Relax lah / 不要想太多." → Trivialises distress → "I hear this is upsetting; let's find support."

Rules of thumb  
• Never link abuse to race, religion, or family honour  
• Emphasise courage in seeking help; counter shame  
• Use caller's preferred language; keep tone respectful-formal
