## Overview

**Candling** is a 24/7 AI voice agent designed to support crisis response teams by automating routine calls and paperwork. Built for the [Vapi Build Challenge](https://vapi.ai/build), Candling empowers frontline responders to focus on urgent, high-impact cases.

Inspired by lived experience and research into responder workloads, Candling addresses two major pain points in crisis intervention:
- Callersâ€™ hesitation to seek help
- Responder overload from paperwork and low-priority calls

## Key Features

1. **Empathetic Listening & Guidance**
   - Listens and responds in line with global counseling standards (e.g., WHO Psychological First Aid)
   - Guides callers to appropriate care specialists

2. **Real-Time Triage & Escalation**
   - Analyses sentiment and urgency during calls
   - Filters routine queries and escalates emergencies directly to human responders

3. **Automated Case Briefs**
   - Generates structured post-call summaries, detailed transcripts, and recommended follow-ups
   - Reduces paperwork for next-day teams, enabling fast and informed support
